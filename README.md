# STM32 Embedded Projects

## Overview
This repository contains embedded systems projects using STM32 Nucleo-C031C6 and STM32CubeIDE. The focus is on interfacing essential components like keypads, push buttons, and LCDs for control systems.

## Projects Included
- 4x4 Matrix Keypad interfacing
- Push Button with debouncing and state control
- 16x2 LCD Display interfacing
- Combined input-display control system

## Tools & Environment
- STM32CubeIDE
- STM32 HAL Drivers
- Wokwi Simulator for virtual prototyping

## Concepts Covered
- GPIO configuration
- Timer-based delay and debounce
- Polling vs Interrupt-driven input
- LCD command/data handling in 4-bit mode

## Project Status
Fully functional simulation and testing complete on Wokwi and STM32CubeIDE.

## Future Scope
- Add buzzer & LED feedback system
- Extend to passcode-based access control
- Integrate EEPROM or external sensor modules
